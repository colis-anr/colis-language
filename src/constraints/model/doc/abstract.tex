This paper presents a specification based testing of POSIX utilities 
manipulating the file system, e.g., copy, moving or removing files and directories.
The specification used in this work is the outcome of the Colis project, 
which proposed a formal specification of POSIX utilities using the 
Feature Tree Logic (FTL).
To obtain test suites for a POSIX command, we propose an algorithm 
which synthesizes the model of the command's specification. 
The model is then used to create the input file system of the 
command under test and to check that the output file system 
conforms to the formal specification.
We report on the application of this method to several POSIX commands.
The main result we obtained is the improvement of the FTL specifications 
for dealing with special file system's paths.
